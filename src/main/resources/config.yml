# Randomizer @version@ by motz0815
# Here, the random block - item partners are listed
# Changing this per hand is not recommended, although if you do it correctly, it should work.
# If nothing except "partners:" is in here, you haven't typed the command "/randomizer shuffle" on this server once.
#
# The Plugin is activated by default, if you want to deactivate it, use the ingame command "/randomizer stop"
# Adjusting this value here will not change anything until you reload or restart the server itself.
